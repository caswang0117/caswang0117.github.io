Although, there’s also times that I can see – in my box of 25 screens, whoever happens to be in it – I’m finding now that I can still pull things from them. So that it doesn’t have to be me internally focused and going through something and you just happen to be there witnessing it, that there is this ability for us to see each other. A lot about outward focus, trying to change the pattern and notice how… internally focused you might be when teaching or researching and trying to get out of that. And also, in the physical space, there’s such an exchange of energy in the room that you can really feel. That was almost like the biggest shift now that I’m isolated in a room teaching to a computer screen, that exchange.<br><br>But I’m recognizing defaults in my own personal movements and expressions. A way of letting my energy echo out further, that I can try to potentially make you feel where I’m at through the screen. You know, it’s a little bit more effort or oomph behind movements, and a little bit more letting go and allowing movements to echo and leave me, but recognizing that as a new territory for me as a dancer, performer, mover."</p>
