            <p style="float:left">"Now that it’s online, it’s a little bit more personal. It’s a little bit more about me going through a physical research and sharing that with you, as opposed to me feeling like I can really see all the, potentially, hundreds of people in the "room" and comment. Although, there’s also times that I can see – in my box of 25 screens, whoever happens to be in it – I’m finding now that I can still pull things from them. So that it doesn’t have to be me internally focused and going through something, and you just happen to be there witnessing it. That there is this ability for us to see each other. I'm thinking a lot about outward focus, trying to change the pattern, and notice how internally focused I might be when teaching or researching. I'm trying to get out of that. Also, in the physical space, there’s such an exchange of energy in the room that you can really feel. That was almost the biggest shift now that I’m isolated in a room teaching to a computer screen, that exchange. <br><br>

              But I’m recognizing defaults in my own personal movements and expressions. A way of letting my energy echo out further, that I can try to potentially make you feel where I’m at through the screen. It’s a little bit more effort or oomph behind movements, and a little bit more letting go and allowing movements to echo and leave me, but I'm recognizing that as a new territory for me as a dancer, performer, mover."<br></p>

	        <p>"When I first did online [classes], it was a reminder of the in-person classes. But just recently, I am discovering some new things, where it’s no longer just a memory of a past class, but that there’s something new that I’ve just discovered today. That I’ve never done before, that I’ve never touched in the classes in Tel Aviv. I’m connecting more to the online now, where it feels like there are new areas of research that the teachers are showing me. It’s like, “Oh, I don’t think he’s ever mentioned this before.” That’s been great, those moments where I feel like there’s something new here. I think it’s fantastic...<br><br>

	        As a non-dancer, this idea of working with images itself is so new. The whole concept that you can use that to power a movement, it was a very foreign concept to me... It blew my mind that you can do that—and not only can you do that, but when someone’s doing that, you can see it in their body. That blew my mind. A teachable voice, a certain kind of imagery, and then you could see it in their body... Just the fact that you can do that is amazing to me, and that it can be learned."</p>

        	<h4 class="my-auto">Through Gaga, I think this connection with the body is something I value even more... This thing that I suspected was important truly is important.</h4>

        <p>"The whole experience felt like there is no fear or uncertainty about what your body can do. The body isn’t as precious, and pain and fatigue and everything, those aren’t bad things. I notice the emphasis on not judging those sensations as negative, but leaning into them. It’s kind of sadist[ic] in a way, like the pleasure of squeezing the abs and feeling really tired. It felt like a really loving and fearless process and experience, and I could really feel that. Afterwards, I was just really sweaty and euphoric... <br><br>

        You can feel your own body, and working hard doesn’t become bad, which is key. I need more of that. I need to train my mind more that way if I’m going to want to do more dance, because you can’t be mad about being sore, or working hard, or being tired, because those are all things that have to come with moving and feeling these pleasures too... If you pay attention to that effort dial and enjoy the play, and start to enjoy playing with that, then I think you have access to a lot of different types of movement that have a lot of different types of looks and effects in performance. That’s something I really care about when I’m trying to choreograph, but I don’t always emphasize effort qualities. Gaga is a fun way of doing that."</p>

        <p>"I actually think, because it’s taught online, there’s something that goes on with how we think… I think with studying in home and at home, you’re more noticing, 'Oh, wait, I do Gaga in this place so I can research more everywhere.' I’ll notice myself even in the shower, just feeling the water trickle down. 'Oh, well that’s what it’s like to float,' or taking a cold shower and turning the water all the way cold, and I’ll be like, 'That’s the sensation they’re talking about and what they want to research.' I think it’s making it more physical in a sense, because I’m actually searching for the physical sensations that they research, as opposed to just imagining them in my head in the studio. I’m actually home, I can actually turn on the cold shower and feel that sensation through my body, and then bring it into the Gaga class either later that night or the next day.<br><br>

        When it’s online, sometimes I feel like I can dig a little bit deeper, because I’m one of the people who will turn off the camera and it’s just me in my room. No one’s even watching me, which I think is a gift to have, because I’ve already had those in-person classes so I’ve been able to know what the research is within the community. It’s mainly just focusing on myself now... When I do take it, it’s more about just me in this room and no one watching, which is really special. But it also has been hard because you don’t have that community of everyone screaming out the numbers when you’re counting down within the effort. I feel those efforts are a lot harder to be encouraged by everyone else, because all you can hear is the teacher. When I’m back in class now, I can hear everyone yelling out numbers because everyone’s bones are shaking and your muscles are aching—you miss that joy of everyone being together in that same effort struggle."</p>
