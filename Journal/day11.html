			      <p>I was a bit reluctant to come take class today because it’s been over a week since I’ve really moved. I always feel better when I do move, but it’s hard to motivate myself.<br><br>

            At class a bit earlier than normal, I start by listening to my body. Today, I want to take more pauses than I usually do. I play with this for a few minutes, and when the teacher starts class, he has us begin by listening. But what happens when I listen, and my body doesn’t want to move in the same rhythm of the class? Is it okay, as long as I keep listening? With the speaker view on Zoom, I always forget that the teacher probably can’t see me and that I don’t always have to go at the same intensity as the teacher. I try to push myself to keep up in person because of my close proximity to the other dancers and the teacher, but I suppose there isn’t really that demand online. No one can make you do anything. But I do know that these classes are aimed to be more or a workout, so maybe that also has me feling a need to push myself to stay with the teacher.<br><br>

            We work a lot with feeling ripples through our bodies, both big and small. Feeling thicker flesh and traveling texture through the body. I struggle with mapping the texture at first, losing track in the block of my torso. But I’ve done it before, so I know I can do it again. I’m glad this part of class is a bit slower so that I can take my time to feel where the textures are in my chest, ribs, shoulders. We focus on the ripple a bit closer to us, bringing less movement to our seaweed spine. <br><br></p>

            <h2>“Feel the space between every vertebrae, like your spine is a stack of sugar cubes. Feel it melting down, slowly.”<br><br></h2>

            <p> As the teacher gives us this image, I feel more space created in my spine. Sugar cubes are small, so I imagine and move with the space between each one. It's different structure than with seaweed, where the whole spine is connected. This melting image brings about a feeling of moving down, even though the ripples are traveling up. It's more of a constant direction and motion that lies beneath the ripples. <br><br>

            Now, we are creating space between our joints and moving our center. “Feel like you have a hot potato somewhere in your cneter. Move your hips away from it. Your ribs away from it. Feel the heat traveling through you.” I made the mistake of eating something spicy right before class, so my stomach is burning a bit with all of the exercise I'm doing. This idea helps me to initiate some movements from deeper in my belly, a place I maybe don’t move from enough. My ribs try to move apart from my hips, hollowing out my center. I feel longer, if that’s possible. <br><br>

            We also work on falling up slower than the speed of gravity and collapsing down quickly. I'm struggling with how when I collapse down, it isn’t all of me. It is maybe my knees or my hips or my arm, but then some other part of me always stays slower than gravity.<br><br>

            Moving feels good. I am tiring of my patterns and in desperate need of inspiration for new ones.
